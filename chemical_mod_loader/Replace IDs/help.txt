Place models you want to *replace* in this folder (Replace IDs)

Feel free to create sub-folders that files will still be read

File names must match the GTASA id name or mta id number to be replaced

If multiple files have the same name, then one will be used (depending on folder name)

You can place .txt/.dat/.ide/.cfg files with vehicle data to be imported
